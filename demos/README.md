The other files in this directory follow the structure of a simple, conceptual demo (phase 1). Aimed to familiarize the reader with the attack technique.
Along with refined state-based demo, (phase 2) which better reflects how the technique is employed at the specific injection vector.
code implementation review will hopefully provide thoughtful conetext to the attack techniques themselves and our groups theoretical proposed defense, "Kernel Delta Thresholding" (KDT)
